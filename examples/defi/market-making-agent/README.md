## Cloning example

To clone the repository, run the following command:

```bash
npx gitpick sendaifun/solana-agent-kit/examples/defi/market-making-agent
```

## Key Features

- **Automated Quoting**: The agent automatically refreshes quotes on an interval.
- **Reducing Complexity**: Designed to abstract away parameters for setting up market making.
- **Random Model**: The market making introduces randomness to prevent front running or other negative botting behaviors.
